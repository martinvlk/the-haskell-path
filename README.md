The Haskell Path
==================
A roadmap for learning functional programming with Haskell - and beyond.

* How is it that people learn and gain intuition for abstraction?
* They begin with the concrete, and move to the abstract.
* By examining concrete objects *in detail*, one begins to notice similarities and patterns, until one comes to understand on a more abstract, intuitive level.
* Most people don’t “get it” immediately: it is only after *examining some specific instances* of the definition, and working through the *implications of the definition in detail*, that one begins to appreciate the definition and gain an understanding of what it “really says.”
* The critical role that *struggling through fundamental details* plays in the building of *intuition*.
